## Blockchain Economics Problem Set 1

This repository contains the code for Problem Set 1 for Martin PARAIRE - 22300561

The problems are computed by the classes inside the Encrypt.py file (Encrypt, PKE and Hash_fun), and are used within the PS_1.py file

## Ancillary files

Attached to these files are my public key public_key_paraire_22300561.pem and my private key private_key_paraire_23300561.pem, used in Question 2 of exercice 1

## Output

The output for each question can be found in the file Message and Output, where one can find the encrypted messages for question 2

The output for hash computation of Exercise 2 can be found in the text file Exercise_2_answer_Paraire_22300561.txt

The output for hash with incrementing complexity for Exercise 2 Question 3 is in increment.txt
